Welcome to Facial Recognition using ML on a custom dataset
We have used 3 models to train and chosen the best model according to our dataset.

First Step is creating your custom dataset:-
* Open the dataset creation notebook
*  Import all necessary libraries
*  give your target names(the amount of labels)
* Select the amount of pictures required to be taken
* run the code

Now to train the model
** Open train_model noebook
* import all librariers
*  Make sure the path to your custom dataset is set correctly
*  Train the model
*  Save the model
*  take live detection

 all the code is given in the notebook

We implemented the model on a raspberry pi (3B)
Set up your Raspberry pi and import the model file(.pkl) and the Rpi_code notebook to Raspberry pi
Run the code to get live detection

Thank you
