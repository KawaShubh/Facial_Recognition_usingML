Welcome to Facial Recognition using ML on a custom dataset
We have used 3 models to train and chosen the best model according to our dataset.

First Step is creating your custom dataset:-
a. Open the dataset creation notebook
b. Import all necessary librariers
c. Give your target names(the amount of labels)
d. Select the amount of pictures required to be taken
e. run the code

Now to train the model
a. import all librariers
b. Make sure the path to your custom dataset is set correctly
c.Train the model 
d. Save the model
d. Take live detection

* all the code is given in the notebook

We implemented the model on a raspberry pi (3B)
Set up your Raspberry pi and import the model file(.pkl) and the Rpi_code notebook to Raspberry pi
Run the code to get live detection

Thank you
